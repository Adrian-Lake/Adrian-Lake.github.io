          <p>
            In order to provide a quick primer in Javascript for the CodeMakers camp of GeeringUp, a quick turorial was made given a 3 day allotment for curricul planning. The tutorial had to provide a convienet way of executing code and preventing crashes where were expected when loop useage was taught. As such the Javascript tutorial implements web workers to manage execution, in addition templating is used for  individual components and checks the evaluation of the code to see if the student has correctly followd instruction.
